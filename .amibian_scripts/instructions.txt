 1. system setup / raspi-config
 	Exit the emulator you have running, if you are running 
   one. If you are in the CLI, press '7' and enter, you can also 
   open the same settings program by typing 'sudo raspi-config', 
   'amibian-config' or 'settings'. If you are in the Amibian 
   desktop, open the applications menu (the amibian logo in the 
   bottom left corner). From there you open the 'help' section and 
   there you press 'system settings'
 
   You can do most of your setup in this configuration tool.
   Select how Amibian will boot. setup wifi. setup ssh, setup 
   keyboard.

   You use the arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate through the
   options, enter to select, esc to go back.

   Some of those can also be done from the Amibian Desktop.
 
   Please use this tool to update your system. using the standard
   apt-get update and upgrade may break the system. 
 
 2. Amibian Desktop.
    	Amibian desktop is a lxde desktop. you can use it as you
    would any other desktop. there are some useful apps 
    pre-installed and shortcuts to them are found in the bottom
    toolbar. Shortcuts to emulators can be found in a hidden toolbar
    on the right side of the screen, to see that toolbar, move your
    mouse cursor all the way to the right, middle screen and it will
    appear.

    Changing screen resolution in Amibian Desktop.
   
   	open the applications menu, ->preferences->Display settings
    Select the resolution and refresh rate you want, press apply to 
    see if it works ok. if it works you can press save. if it doesn't
    work the settings will be reverted after a few seconds.
    ---
    Change the keyboard layout.
  
   	because of a bug, changing the layout in the keyboard layout
    handler will not be saved after a system restart. To set your 
    layout and save it, you need to do it manually.
   
    open terminal and type
   
    'sudo nano /home/amibian/.config/lxpanel/LXDE-pi/panels/panel'
   
    Scroll down to line number 77, there you see a layout list.
    First letters is the default keyboard layout, then comes the
    secondary layouts, (you can change from default to a secondary
    layout by pressing the flag in the top right corner.)
    change these letters to the layouts you want. Google for the 
    name for your preferrd layout if you are not sure.
   
    After you have made the changes you want, press 'ctrl + x' to
    quit. You will be asked to confirm that you want to save the
    changes you made. Press 'Y' for yes, 'N' for no. If you press
    'Y' you are asked to confirm file name and location,
    press enter to overwrite the file.
   
    Exit the terminal and reboot the system.
  
 3. copying files.
    
    	To copy files from a flashdrive to your sd card/system
    you can use midnight commander file manager from cli or you
    can use the Amibian desktop.
